### Free-MP3-Download.net

Free-MP3-Download.net was a cherished resource for high-quality music downloads. Its closure in April 2024 marked a meaningful loss, yet I am deeply grateful for the invaluable service it provided. Transitioning to [DoubleDouble.top](https://doubledouble.top/) was a fortunate decision, offering an even broader selection of music from popular streaming platforms while maintaining the high standards needed for my digital preservation system.

### DoubleDouble.top

On August 28, 2024, I found a message on DoubleDouble.top:

> This website will be shut down eventually (no confirmed date/time) to be replaced by our new site - Lucida. Use [Lucida](https://lucida.to/) instead.

I extend my heartfelt appreciation for the time and service DoubleDouble.top offered and eagerly anticipate exploring what Lucida has in store. Thank you for the memories and the music!

### Aniwave.to

AniWave and Fmovies were shut down in August 2024. Their operators were reportedly Vietnamese, and Fmovies was founded in 2016. I am grateful for the years of anime streaming and have since transitioned to HiAnime.to. Thank you for the entertainment and joy you've brought into my life.
