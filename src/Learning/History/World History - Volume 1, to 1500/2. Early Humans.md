# 2 Early Human

## 2.1 Early Human Evolution and Migration

### Objectives

- Discuss human evolution in biological and anthropological contexts.
- Explain Paleolithic human migration reasons and patterns.
- Describe Paleolithic tools and technologies.

#### Human Evolution

Australopithecus lived in eastern and southern Africa between 2.5 and 4 million years ago. Homo habilis, emerging about 2-3 million years ago, was once thought to be the first stone tool user, but tools predate them. Around 2 million years ago, Homo erectus appeared in East Africa, likely evolving from Homo habilis. Homo erectus, known for upright walking, had anatomical changes leading to dietary shifts and increased dexterity for tool use. Their migration started between 1.8 and 1.5 million years ago, expanding into North Africa, the Near East, Europe, and Asia.

#### Why Did Humans Move and Where Did They Go?

Homo sapiens began migrating from eastern and southern Africa around 200,000 years ago, with a significant exodus around 100,000 years ago during an ice age, when dry land was exposed. The drying climate in Africa, reducing available resources, likely triggered this migration. As hunter-gatherers, humans moved in search of better living conditions.

#### Early Human Technologies

Stone tool use started around 3.3 million years ago, marking the Paleolithic Age. The earliest known tools, dating from 2.6 million years ago, were Oldowan tools likely created by Homo habilis. Around 1.7 million years ago, more sophisticated Acheulean hand-axes emerged, lasting until about 250,000 years ago. Mousterian tools, smaller and made from stone flakes, appeared next.

By at least 125,000 years ago, humans had mastered fire control for warmth, predator deterrence, cooking, and tool-making.

Language use, emerging at least 100,000 years ago, became a key evolutionary advantage, facilitating communication and cooperation.
